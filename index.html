        <h1>Never not learning.</h1>
          <p>
              I started writing code in elementary school. The basic stuff, just some HTML to give my Neopets account some pizzaz. Segue into college where I dove deep by first learning Python and then took more advanced classes using java. While working coffee shop jobs to help pay my way through school I not only gained excellent communication skills,  I also connected with some industry folks which lead to my internship opportunity at Good Mood Creators. There I got my hands dirty with the Unity development environment. It was incredible to be involved with an industry Iâ€™ve had a passion for all my life, and meeting other developers with the same interests made me even more driven to accomplish my dreams.
              At Epicodus I gained my web development exposure. Coming for a more traditional CS background with heaps of Java and C#, admittedly JavaScript and Ruby were weird at first. That quickly changed and I fell in love. This was not just a love of the languages, but a love of the community. The blog writers, open source contributors, podcasters, youtubers, and devs I met at local meetups won me over - I knew I had to be a part of it.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              In my spare time you can find me working on my side projects, reading (huge sci-fi and nordic noir fan), hiking, knitting or playing games (video and analog). I love traveling.

              <h2>Heima (A Cozy Front-End Library)</h2>
              <p>
                A front-end library that is meant to invoke a homey feeling, the feeling I get when writing code with a hot beverage. 

                Once I started really getting into Sass and front-end development, I noticed I would often go back to older projects and resuse components I made before. My younger brother observed the same and together we decided to start building an open source front end library together. We've started off with smaller components, like simple buttons and animations. We have large plans for Heima and welcome anyone interested to contribute.
                
                Heima means "at home" in Icelandic, and that's the feeling we hope it instills in the folks that use it.

            <h2>Math Problem Generator</h2>
            <p>
              Angular 2 application for grade school math teachers that allows the user to enter an equation, set parameters for variables (decimal point, minimum value, maximum value), choose the variable to sovle for, number of problems desired and then displays a table of values for each variable.

              In this project my small team identified and addressed existing tech debt as well as refactored the existing code base using higher order functions and reduced total lines of code by 60%. Additionally, we throughly documented the code base for those that would follow, implemented bug-fixes, and added on new features, including accounting for decimal variables within the equations.

        <h1>Let's work together!</h1>
        <p>
          My two life mottos are "never not learning" and "teamwork makes the dreamwork". To me, it's important to work with people who acknowledge that soft skills are just as important as technical ones. I do well in environments where I can collaborate with other developers and constantly be learning new, bleeding edge, tech. I enjoy a consistent challenge where I can stay on top of the new development trends. For the time being, I'd like to stay in the JavaScript realm and am currently working on mastering React. Responsive web development is the bees knees. I also have an active interest in exploring native applications.
